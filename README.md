✌🏼 I'm Juan Anzola, a political scientist that knows how to program AI systems.

🤓 I love tech and how it opens a wide range of possibilities to solve business problems. That's what I feel passionate about.

🏆I've participated in several tech competitions and challenges.

😏 If you are interested, I know...

- How to use the AWS stack for ML, Data Lakes, ETLs and serverless architectures.
- How to code in Python (and now I'm learning Javascript).
- How to solve your business questions using SQL and dashboards.
- How to work with unstructured data, specially text and images.
